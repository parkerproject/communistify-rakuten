# ***C O M M U N I S T I F Y***-rakuten

Rakuten has that search feature that lets you earn some points when you search stuff. Thus, this Chrome extension is made to automatically collect all 30 "entries" for you so that you force Rakuten to share their profit, which is pretty communist.

## Prequisities
* Chrome
* [Rakuten toolbar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%E6%A5%BD%E5%A4%A9%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%83%96%E6%A4%9C%E7%B4%A2/iihkglbebihpaflfihhkfmpabjgdpnol) (Or you can't search)
* The extension won't log into your Rakuten account for you. Make sure you log in and your cookie for `*.rakuten.co.jp` is properly stored.

## Steps
1. **Click into the toolbar to see if Rakuten is doing some event.** In these cases, you'll have to register into these events by yourself. e.g. "Search 5 times for 5 days to get 2x more points in Rakuten-Ichiba". Of course, you can skip this step if you're not going to use Rakuten-Ichiba for now.
2. Click the extension icon
3. Start
4. Check if all 30 "entries" are hacked into
5. 1 day later Rakuten will send you 1~5 points (Depending on the day).
6. Use these points **within 2 years**.
